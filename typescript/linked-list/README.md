# Linked List

**Linked List** is one of the data structure that can be used to overcome some drawbacks (well-known issues) found in Array data structure such as **memory inefficiency** (i.e., in Array, we'll need to pre-allocate memory before using it, hence this can lead to an over-estimated capacity). Further reading on this can be easily found using your finger in Google :-).

**Linked List** can be divided into different categories as follow:

1. Singly (Single) Linked List
2. Doubly (Double) Linked List
3. Circular Linked List
4. Doubly Circular Linked List
